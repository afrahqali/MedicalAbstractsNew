  12651186.ti.2: The EU-funded project IDEA aimed to evaluate (a) what parameters and endpoints allow the detection of endocrine-mediated developmental and reproductive effects of (xeno)estrogens in life cycle- and life stage-specific toxicity tests with the zebrafish Danio rerio, a small laboratory fish used in many ecotoxicity test guidelines, and (b) whether substances that act as estrogens in vertebrates may also adversely affect the development, differentiation, and reproduction of aquatic invertebrates.

  11390169.ti.14: Molecular mechanisms that apparently contributed to BDE inhibition of decidual metabolism included the synthesis of protein and DNA involved in decidual growth, the synthesis and activation of a matrix metalloproteinase for degradation of the extracellular matrix that is essential for tissue remodeling during deciduoma development, and the nitric oxide/nitric oxide synthase and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide systems that are involved in promoting vasodilation and increased vascular permeability to enhance the availability of substrates for maximal deciduoma growth.

  20434143.ti.14: With any two-fold increase of PbB outcome changed markedly, namely up to 35%. 
  20434143.ti.15: Restriction to children with PbBs<10mug/dl had only a marginal influence on outcome.

  20434143.ti.16: The converging evidence from performance- and questionnaire data confirms that core elements of ADHD are adversely affected by low environmental PbB even below 10mug/dl, but not by other neurotoxic trace metals.
