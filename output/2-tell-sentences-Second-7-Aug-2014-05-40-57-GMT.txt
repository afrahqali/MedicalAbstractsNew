1	21561829	[79-94-7]_[tetrabromobisphenol A]	endocrine	We investigated whether BPA and its halogenated analogs could be ligands of estrogen receptors (ERs) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) and act as endocrine disrupting chemicals|We measured the binding affinities to PPARγ by competitive binding assays with [3H] rosiglitazone and investigated the impact of TBBPA and TCBPA on adipocyte differentiation using NIH3T3 L1 cells|We also found evidence that activation of ERα, ERβ, and PPARγ depends on the degree of halogenation in BPA analogs|Our results strongly suggest that polyhalogenated bisphenols could function as obesogens by acting as agonists to disrupt physiological functions regulated by human or animal PPARγ|

2	12712450	[79-06-1]_[Acrylamide]	breast	We found no evidence of interaction with age, gender, alcohol and tobacco use|Our data provide reassuring evidence for the lack of an important association between consumption of fried/baked potatoes and cancer risk|
